Hi there!

It's my final project on java bootcamp in Software Development Academy - Application for rent movies (August 2021).

Idea of applicatios is to rent a movie on DVD or Blu-Ray and send it to a customer by courier. 
A little bit old school theese days :)

To run application you need to get a database by simple type in terminal command: docker-compose up -d

Tech stack:
- java 11
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- Flayway
- PostgreSQL
- TestContainer
- Docker
- MapStruck
- Lombok
- Swagger
- Trello (https://trello.com/b/x11Szq14/movieapp)
